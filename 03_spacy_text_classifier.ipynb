    "\n",
    "In this project, sentiment analysis is done using natural language processing on the online reviews prevalant for various items \n",
    "on amazon, yelp and imdb which were lablelled.  The data set contains about 1,000 online reviews each for various items on Amazon, Yelp and IMDB, where roughly 500 were labelled positive and 500 were labelled negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Python spaCy package to preprocess the data before, each individual review has been tokenized, lemmatized, filtered for stop words and vectorized to prepare the data for  machine learning models. A pipeline is created which vectorizes the preprocessed data using count vectorization, followed by tfidf vectorizer, which is then split into training and testing datasets, which are then used to train the machine learning models and evaluate."
