       " I stayed at the Sheraton in Back Bay from November 21-25 for a business conference.,\n",
       " For a hotel whose primary purpose is to serve business travelers, I was horrified at the lack of complimentary services and the quality of those that that I was charged for.,\n",
       " Wired internet was $9.95 per night and very unreliable-- on the third night of my stay, the automatic prompt for daily payment wouldn't load.,\n",

       " Again, this is unacceptable for a hotel that claims it's for business travelers.,\n",
       " As for my room, I had a spectacular view from the 24th floor in the north tower, but that was really where the postives stopped.,\n",
       " My single room (queen bed) was incredibly small.,\n",
       " The desk was positioned at the foot of the bed and it was impossible to push the desk chair back all the way out from under the desk to get in and out because it hit the bed!,\n",
       " There was barely any clearance between the chair and bed even when the chair was pushed all the way under the desk.,\n",

       " TV channels were limited and four out of five nights the satellite signal went out repeatedly while I was watching.,\n",
       " Valet parking is absurdly expensive at $41 per night.,\n",
       " Overall, the room was liveable but certainly no where near comfortable.,\n",

       " Would stay again at the drop of a hat.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Too Small for Too Much Money The pros of this hotel: relatively convenient to Amtrak Train station; very convenient to the Hynes Convention center T, shopping, and eating; the staff was very friendly; free wi-fi and computers in lobby; Starbucks coffee in room and in lobby; pool and exercise room very nice (complete with sauna and locker rooms)Cons: the rooms are super tiny; our room backed up to an elevator, which was noisy all night, bathrooms are very small as well; our shower had cracked tiles and grout with mold/mildew in it; housekeeping came at random times during the day, so we never knew when they would show up; wired internet is $10/day; pool deck poorly designed and is VERY slippery bordering on a lawsuit waiting to happen.,\n",
       " If you're traveling alone and attending a function at the convention center, I would recommend this place.,\n",
       " But if you've got more than one person in your room, you should look elsewhere.,\n",

       " Wired internet in the rooms: $9.99, and it's slow.,\n",
       " Carpets throughout the room areas, both inside the room I stayed in, and generally outside in the hallways were in need of replacement or at least significant cleaning.,\n",
       " Room was dingy, old furniture, nicked and chipped up, Workspace for laptop work was stingy - no wrist supports, ethernet cable just barely stretched such that one can recline on the bed and compute.,\n",
       " Room was quite small - reservation said king, but when I arrived it was a queen bed jammed in this little room.,\n",
       " Bathroom reminded me of high school, same kind of industrial, bowl-less design.,\n",
       " Couple more pluses, actually: staff was pretty decent overall, and whoever does their elevator planning deserves an A+ - in spite of being quite busy, never had to wait for more than 10-15 seconds for an elevator at the lobby level.,\n",
       " Note I've been mostly staying in BB lately, so it had been a while since I've had to stay in a chain hotel.,\n",
       " Never again - no more chain hotels, certainly Sheraton is pushed waaay down on the list now, Motel 6 for them.,\n",

       " Room was on the 17th floor of the north tower.bathroom was spacious,room a fine size and we had a great view of cambridge and the massachussetts turnpike and could just see fenway park.,\n",
       " Mostly had breakfast in the prudential centre but had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning.,\n",
       " Like all hotels it was dear enough but you could stock up as often as you wanted with the breakfast buffet for $20.Better options in the prudential centre or nearby try the pour house on newberry street.,\n",
       " The free internet access in the lobby was often unavailable with sometimes only 1 out of 6 computers working but that was only a small problem.,\n",
       " Staff were obliging and very helpful.,\n",
       " Overall,this was a much better hotel than we had been led to believe from previous reviews and we had little or no problems there.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Hang on to your confirmation I wish I could give 4 stars for the hotel and 2 stars for check-in.,\n",
       " We stayed here for one night on 9/18.,\n",
       " We had RESERVED a Club Level room through Starwood points (this is a great deal, only 1,000 points more than a regular room).After a rocky dropping off of the car (there were no valets around, so we got the attention of the doorman, then had to deal with the irate suddenly appearing valets because we usurped their tip...ah, it was not pleasant)...on to the inside...checking in and I knew in advance that the North Tower was the Club level, and where we were supposed to be, but the check in clerk assigns us a room in the South Tower...hmmm...I said what a pain, you mean we have to come down in the elevator to the lobby, cross over, then go up to the North Tower for the concierge lounge?,\n",
       " He says your room does not have access to the CL, but we can give you it for an extra fee...I said I RESERVED the Club Level, he asked to see my confirmation, I whipped it out...AND HE HAD TO GO IN THE BACK TO CHECK WITH HIS SUPERVISORI felt like I was buying a car!,\n",
       " well, Ma'am, I'll go ask my boss if we can swing this monthly payment...he comes back and tap tap tap on the computer and suddenly we were in a CL room that 10 minutes before had been not available.,\n",
       " Hors d'oeuvres were great, dessert was great, breakfast was fine (cold Continental)...well worth the 1,000 extra points.,\n",
       " I loved sitting there overlooking the Charles...the room was nothing special - it DID have the Ralph Lauren decor as promised, but it's an old hotel built in the 70's or whenever so the rooms aren't HUGE, the bathrooms are SMALL, but the nicely renovated room and the club level were well worth it.,\n",
       " \n",
       " A hotel designed by accountants This is the second time this year I've stayed at a Sheraton, and the general experience is the same.,\n",
       " The hotel feels as though it was designed by accountants.,\n",
       " There is no attention to the comfort of those of us who stay here, rather the attention is on the photo-ops and the lobby.,\n",
       " Lobby was lovely.,\n",
       " Room was pretty bad.,\n",
       " Bed was large, but the bedding was uncomfortable and scratchy and the pillows, though plentiful, were hard-as-a-rock horrors.,\n",
       " The window didn't open though the view was ok.,\n",
       " Curtains didn't close all the way.,\n",
       " The bathroom was passable but no better than a cheap motel on the highway.,\n",
       " Online access cost $$ and was by 1 ethernet cable - not wireless - so only one of us could go online at a time.,\n",
       " Soda machines owned by Pepsi so a pathetic few overpriced choices of overly large pepsi products in hideous plastic bottles, no cans, no other brands.,\n",
       " Complimentary USA Today which I really HATE.,\n",
       " How about a Boston Globe, folks?,\n",
       " Oh, and the decor in the hallways was flat out hideous.,\n",
       " Hire a decorator with taste, Sheraton, how's that for a revolutionary idea?,\n",
       " The price for this mediocrity was outrageous.,\n",
       " Note to self: don't go to Sheratons, they rip you off.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Room allocation is critical it would seem Stayed here 3 nights in mid September whilst at a conference in the adjoining Hynes Convention Center.,\n",
       " The hotel is convenient as it is part of the Prudential Center and thus its a very short inside walk to the convention center.,\n",
       " As a result of this (and because of reading some of the reviews here on Trip Advisor regrading the food) we didn't use any of the hotel facilities as the Prudential Center has everything one needs.,\n",
       " Room allocation appears to be key.,\n",
       " This is borne out reading other reviews.,\n",
       " My room was very small with an uncomfortably small bath room.,\n",
       " The room suffered from significant plumbing noises.,\n",
       " I couldn't decided whether this was something to do with the aircon or it was water rushing through pipes.,\n",
       " Whatever there was an obtrusive rushing sound and then a 'bang' when it cut off.,\n",
       " Given that the noise generally started about 4:00am ish and continued relentlessly throughout the remainder of the early morning I suspect it was the plumbing, or specifically, the flushing.,\n",
       " On the plus side thee bed was very comfortable and everything in the room worked.,\n",
       " The walls in this part of the hotel (North Tower - 20th floor) are thin and it was noisy.,\n",
       " For example could hear next door flicking the light switches.,\n",
       " Others have commented on this.,\n",
       " So, judging on my experience alone, I'd not be impressed.,\n",
       " However, my colleague down the hall had a much bigger room and none of the aforementioned issues!,\n",
       " As a SPG member with a few points to my name I would have expected a better room - a feeling confirmed when it transpired that my colleague and I had inadvertently swapped rooms and I should have been in the bigger one without the plumbing noises.,\n",
       " It does make me wonder however whether the 'noisy small' rooms are allocated to those paying the conference rate or whether it was just luck of the draw.,\n",
       " Internet was $9.95 + $.50 'telephone tax' for 24 hours and worked fine.,\n",
       " They also have free wifi in the lobby so if you just want to check email in the morning/evening you don't have to pay at all.,\n",
       " For me the experience was adequate - my colleague would rate it higher.,\n",
       " If I had the choice between this hotel and one of equal standard at the same rate I'd try the other.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Treat the desk clerks nicely I stayed at the sheraton boston for 3 nights at the beggining of the month.,\n",
       " I was checking in late, around 8pm and the guy in front of me was arguing with the front desk clerk over not having club access, this is apparently the special top floor of the hotel with included breakfast and snacks as I was to find out later.,\n",
       " When I got to the desk I was expecting the worst but was greeted with a smile even after he was just chewed out.,\n",
       " The clerk made great small talk and after tipping him a 20 we were upgraded to a beautiful suite on the Club level which had a fantastic view and included access to a continental breakfast and some snacks at night.,\n",
       " Im from Las Vegas and I know how far tipping the front desk goes.,\n",
       " They have a beautiful swimming pool with a retractable roof and friendly cleaning staff.,\n",
       " Even the made who spoke very little english was genuinely friendly and was always smiling.,\n",
       " Theres a ton of great shopping within walking distance and great restaurants as well, try Haru for excellent sushi!,\n",
       " The concierge staff blew me away with their knowledge of the area and Jerry was more than kind enough to help with any reservations or suggestions.,\n",
       " Dont be afraid to walk this city if the weather is nice, you are walking distance from everything and we found ourselves walking from one place to another just exploring the sites until we found ourselves on the other side of town!,\n",
       " but if you end up too far away theres always the subway which goes right to the prudential center where the hotel is located.,\n",
       " all in all a wonderful stay.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Love the Sheraton!!,\n",
       " But thin walls... I loved this hotel.,\n",
       " It was near enough perfect.,\n",
       " The staff were very very friendly and did not hesitate to help you with any queries that we had.,\n",
       " It was in a perfect location with a trolley stop right outside your front door.,\n",
       " The hotel was attached onto a shopping mall which was perfect for having breakfast in the morning.,\n",
       " We used to pop into 'Au bon pain' every morning.,\n",
       " It is also right next door to a cheesecake factory which is just a lush dining experience.,\n",
       " We stayed on the 25th floor and the views were spectacular.,\n",
       " The beds were also really comfortable.,\n",
       " There was only one slight problem.,\n",
       " The walls were very thin so you could hear everything that was going on in your neighbours room, even thier nocturnal activities if you understand what I mean... \n",
       " No character but overall worth the money Well positioned hotel (Prudential stop on the subway) - not a lot to recommend it from a character point of view but has excellent facilities - especially the beds that are enormous.,\n",
       " Good service and pool and gym area was a bonus.,\n",
       " Free internet access in the lobby and a starbucks made it the perfect base to explore Boston from for a few days.,\n",
       " \n",
       " No compliants for the Sheraton Boston!,\n",
       " Great room with a great view!,\n",
       " Lovely to gaze out of the window when the city lights are on.,\n",
       " Room was cosy, quiet, and spacious.,\n",
       " The bed was dreamy indeed!,\n",
       " I could have stayed in it and not gone to any of the 3-day conference which I came for. :,\n",
       " -)Hotel is connected to Prudential Center, which offers lots of shopping (some not for cheap) and a food court.,\n",
       " Browsed around there on some breaks from the conference.,\n",
       " The Center has a beautiful courtyard you can go sit outside and read or eat.,\n",
       " The Sheraton is within walking distance of restaurants, grocery stores, the T line, and other hotels.,\n",
       " We took the T to all the touristy spots like Cheers and Havard.,\n",
       " It's also minutes from the Charles River... so if you want to go for a walk on the paved paths, it's not far.,\n",
       " The only thing that I didn't get is why the hotel doesn't have more signs on it so you can see it when exiting the T station.,\n",
       " No shuttle services to the airport, either, which I also thought was strange.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Loved it!!,\n",
       " Firstly a great hotel.,\n",
       " The sheraton was in a perfect location for us, pretty central and pretty close to the airport.,\n",
       " Upon arrival we were greated by an amazing lobby, with marble floors and great lighting.,\n",
       " The staff were fantastic, very helpful and the checkin was a breeze.,\n",
       " We stayed in a standard room, which was fantastic, the room had 2 double beds and was great.,\n",
       " I love the colour scheme of the room, and the beds were great!The bathrooms were a different story, there were very dated and were not great, but the room really did make up for the bathroom.,\n",
       " The sheets used by the shearton are top notch and soooo comfy.,\n",
       " Another handy feature used by this hotel is in room check out which was great.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Very much Satisfied I should start off by saying I booked this 2 night stay (9/6 to 9/8) through my sister who works for Starwood.,\n",
       " This might have had some impact on the room I was given  my experience.,\n",
       " Check in/out was quick even though we were early for check in by a few hours.,\n",
       " We were on the starwood preferred guests floor.,\n",
       " I don't know what that entails.,\n",
       " I was in room 2665 which had a king size bed, desk  chair, flat screen tv (32 inches I think), sofa chair w/ foot rest, small ottoman under a full length mirror, and a cushioned bench at the foot of the bed.,\n",
       " The mattress was VERY comfortable.,\n",
       " The room was clean.,\n",
       " It had 2 huge windows (corner room) which had fabulous views of boston.,\n",
       " The maid service was good.,\n",
       " Replaced all towels  toiletries  tidied up.,\n",
       " We used valet parking.,\n",
       " It was about $40 a day.,\n",
       " They ask that you give 30 minutes notice that you need your car but they will get it to you in about 10 minutes.,\n",
       " Internet is $4.50 for 1/2 hour or $9.00 for 24 hours.,\n",
       " Doesn't make much sense to me but we went with the 24 hrs.,\n",
       " We also had some phone charges when the only thing we called was within the hotel.,\n",
       " We probably should have questioned it.,\n",
       " It was a couple of bucks.,\n",
       " The bathroom was clean.,\n",
       " Not the newest but it was pretty nice  clean.,\n",
       " The toilet flushed SO loudly.,\n",
       " It was almost like an airplane.,\n",
       " It woke up my husband one night when I used it in the middle of the night.,\n",
       " We ordered room service breakfast one morning.,\n",
       " The lady who brought it was very nice  rolled it into the room  set everything up for us.,\n",
       " The food wasn't that great though.,\n",
       " I had a coupon for 50% off otherwise it would have been very expensive for mediocre food.,\n",
       " All in all, I liked the hotel  would stay here again.,\n",
       " The negatives I listed didn't affect our stay very much and as my husband says, I am extemely picky  notice everything.,\n",
       " \n",
       " What a difference a room makes We got a special conference rate ($150) and were first given a disappointing room on the 9th floor in the north tower.,\n",
       " It was dark and shabby and smelled of old smoke.,\n",
       " It also had 2 double beds and we had booked a king.,\n",
       " After waiting on hold for 10 minutes with the front desk, we finally went back downstairs to complain.,\n",
       " Finally we were given a room on the top floor (29th) of the south tower.,\n",
       " It's a Starwood Preferred Guest floor.,\n",
       " Wow!,\n",
       " Very nice.,\n",
       " New and tasteful carpet and furnishings, and a fabulous view of the Christain Science Plaza fountain through a huge picture window.,\n",
       " What an improvement!,\n",
       " I'm so glad we didn't settle for the first room.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Great location, great business hotel - Safe bet       Interior of Prudential Center \n",
       " Great room, nice staff, terrible food I stayed at the Boston Sheraton for 4 days while attending a conference on-site there.,\n",
       " My room was very clean, pretty, and comfortable.,\n",
       " I also found the staff to be very friendly, even confirming my late arrival with a personal email.,\n",
       " The hotel food, however, was terrible.,\n",
       " Not much better than TV dinners.,\n",
       " Also, they could do better to soundproof their rooms as you can hear everyone coming and going when they open and close their room door-- it is very loud.,\n",
       " A nice benefit of this hotel is that they have about 10 free computers for use in the lobby.,\n",
       " It is very convenient if you need to work or just check email.,\n",
       " Also, the setting is nice.,\n",
       " Would I stay here again?,\n",
       " I would probably stay across the street at the Marriott where I stayed a few months ago -- the rooms there are smaller but there is much better food and much better sound proofing. (,\n",
       " Both hotels are connected to the mall and conference centre via an enclosed skyway).,\n",
       " \n",
       " Nice hotel I stayed at this hotel for a professional conference.,\n",
       " As far as conference hotels go, this was definitely one of the nicer places I've stayed in.,\n",
       " The staff were nice and courteous and the room was clean.,\n",
       " The other nice aspect of the hotel was it's direct connection to a large mall on the second floor.,\n",
       " In addition, you could not beat the location.,\n",
       " There were several malls and tons of shopping in the area.,\n",
       " We were also walking distance from trollies (i.e. subways) and historic tourist sites.,\n",
       " While not charming like boutique hotels, it was satisfactory for a large chain.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Bed bug bites  I've been traveling for the last 8yrs for work and this was by far one of the worst experience.,\n",
       " I woke up in the middle of the nite with bug bites all over my body.,\n",
       " Not only I had to pack everything and move to a different room, I had to ask this rude staff over and over again for some itch ointment.,\n",
       " The staff is very unprofessional and they treat you like as if you're bothering them when you call.,\n",
       " I can't believe I'm paying all this money(although my company is paying for it) for this kind of service.,\n",
       " I tried to walk over to Hilton, but it's sold out.,\n",
       " Also, ask for South tower, I think that's the newly renovated tower.,\n",
       " I'm still stuck in this old north tower with worn out carpet and furnitures, but I hope the new rooms are cleaner and don't have any bed bugs.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Thin walls at the Sheraton We stayed at the Sheraton July 26-30 and for the most part had a good stay.,\n",
       " The elevators were super fast when we stayed there.,\n",
       " Great location within walking distance to Fenway well really you can walk about anywhere from here and one of the trolley tours stops right across the street from the front of the hotel.,\n",
       " However every night we had noisy neighbors.,\n",
       " The first night the staff had to come get on to them for being loud partying.,\n",
       " The other two nights the couple were doing other things...My husband had to beat on the wall at 4:30 in the morning to get them to be quiet.,\n",
       " When I told staff about it the next day they did give me all of my room charges basically free.,\n",
       " Still doesn't make up for lost sleep though.,\n",
       " So beware of very thin walls here.,\n",
       " Otherwise a great trip and can't wait to come back.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Much Better than expected Given the mixed reviews we were not sure what to expect.,\n",
       " I have to say that we had a great time.,\n",
       " The hotel is a typically anonymous conference style hotel with a dark and somewhat depressing reception and slow front desk service.,\n",
       " Our 2 adjoining rooms on the 19th floor were really good.,\n",
       " The beds were comfortable, the views excellent and with all the facilities you would expect.,\n",
       " The gym is big and the pool, whilst not so big ,was enough to keep the kids happy.,\n",
       " We used the sun terrace and the jacuzzi.,\n",
       " And the location is great.,\n",
       " So not the place to go if you are looking for character or special hotel experience, but it really did the job for us.,\n",
       " \n",
       " DIRTY Room / RUDE Staff My husband and I and three children were disappointed with our stay at the Sheraton Boston last weekend (July 26th - 27th).For starters, before arriving we called the hotel to request two beds and a rollaway cot in the room.,\n",
       " The person with whom we spoke was quite rude and stated that since we booked through Priceline, she could not accomodate any of our requests, that we were wasting our time speaking with her and we would have to see what was available when we arrived.,\n",
       " Be forewarned, as mentioned in other revieiws, when we arrived, we were informed that the only option for parking our car was through the hotel's valet for a cost of $41 per night.,\n",
       " At check-in we requested a renovated room, but we were given a room on the 25th floor of the non-renovated tower.,\n",
       " At that time we requested a rollaway bed/cot.,\n",
       " The 25th floor looks worn (scratched doors, frayed carpet) and our room was horrible (looked like it was decorated in the '80s) - smelly with a huge stain in the middle of the carpet, stains on the dark blue duvet/comforters, rip in the blue velvet curtains, hairs and mold in the bathroom, dirt inside the drawers and a huge TV that looked about 10 years old which didn't get reception on several channels.,\n",
       " We complained, but were told that since we booked through Priceline, our room could not be changed. (,\n",
       " Regardless of how one books their room, it seems to us that guests should be enititled to clean, pleasant rooms...)Three hours after we had checked in, we still had not received the rollaway bed.,\n",
       " We called the front desk to follow up, and after another two hours (long after we had hoped to put our youngest child to bed), the bed was delivered without any extra pillows or blankets.,\n",
       " When we requested these items from the guy who delivered them, he told us that these items were not available because they were all really dirty.,\n",
       " Our kids swam in the pool, but the hotel does not employ any lifeguards, so parents have to keep a close eye on their kids.,\n",
       " Due, in part, to the retractable roof, after sundown the pool area is poorly lit, and it's a bit tough to keep track of three kids in the pool without adequate lighting.,\n",
       " To get to the bathroom/locker room from the pool, you have to go through a freezing cold area where the treadmills are located.,\n",
       " The locker room is gross - uncleaned toilet, filthy showers, hair dryers sitting in puddles of water (not very safe).,\n",
       " All of that being said, the location of the hotel is fabulous - in the heart of Boston and attached to the Prudential Center which is an upscale mall with several restaurants and a great food court (which is convenient when you have kids to feed).,\n",
       " There are several other hotels in this area, and we suggest that if this location appeals to you, that you stay in a different hotel.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Slow Elevators, good location This hotel is well located in the back bay and is connected to the Prudential Center.,\n",
       " Our room was spacious, although the bathroom was small.,\n",
       " We enjoyed the flat screen TV.,\n",
       " The beds were great with nice linens.,\n",
       " The pool was nice with a lap lane and an adjacent hot tub.,\n",
       " My main complaint was the elevators...they were VERY slow.,\n",
       " It took far too long for the elevators to come.,\n",
       " They should really think about updating them.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Really slipped but great location and competitive pricing This used to be one of my favorite hotels and even vactioned here back in the 90's.,\n",
       " Sad to see where it's goneThe service is still courteous with a smile, and you can't beat the location, there is a T stop in the prudential center doesn't get much better for getting around.,\n",
       " Reading some of the other reviews I found myself agreeing more than not.,\n",
       " I've been here in Boston for the last 5 weeks.,\n",
       " I hav stayed at the Marriott and the Hilton all with in a stone throw of the Shraton.,\n",
       " Sadly I rank this one third.,\n",
       " Whats Good.,\n",
       " Decent sized rooms, and hands down the MOST comfortable beds of all the chains in the area.,\n",
       " That's important to any business traveller.,\n",
       " Quality towels and Bath products.,\n",
       " Sheraton doesn't allow those old frayed towels.,\n",
       " The Pool, Gym and lobby are great as well.,\n",
       " Also again the Service is good, everyone projects helpfulness and I believe they are sincere.,\n",
       " What needs improvement.,\n",
       " Well for the bucks it's competitive, but frankly this hotel is in need of some major renovation if it wants to compete with the in room amenities of some of the other hotels.,\n",
       " The TV's and remotes.. well leave much to be desired.,\n",
       " Small Desks- Mine looks like a chouch end table.,\n",
       " Not muchto spreadout on, and If I ordered room service I'd have to move my laptop to the bed.,\n",
       " The toilets look they are right out your high school gym.,\n",
       " Clean yes, but old cracked tiles with stained grout stands out.,\n",
       " The Lamps are flecked with chipped paint from years of use.,\n",
       " And I am wondering the last time my phone was cleaned, as there is an interesting film around the ear hole.,\n",
       " Also No in room safes.,\n",
       " For a business traveller, well frankly it leaves you wanting more.,\n",
       " It reminds me of the old Hamton inn's before the national makeover.,\n",
       " But again The bed almost guarantees you'll sleep well.,\n",
       " Personally I prefer the LAN connections to wi fi.,\n",
       " So for m that's a plus over the Hilton across the street. (,\n",
       " All Wi Fi)Personally I haven't tried the food, becuase there are MANY great eating places all within walking distance.,\n",
       " The menu looks typical.,\n",
       " There's a burger, Pizza, a few salads etc.,\n",
       " Again I recomend eating out just for the variety.,\n",
       " Overall nothing special, it's a hotel, that's seen better days, but hey if you in Boston and just hanging out in your hotel room...well you have much bigger issues than a hotel needing some TLC.,\n",
       " \n",
       " So So The Good - Good location, friendly staff on check in, and many of the amenities that a business traveller might need.,\n",
       " The valet and bellman in the lobby were all very helpful and courteous.,\n",
       " There is also a full service Starbucks (not just a cart) on site in the lobby.,\n",
       " The Bad-Sheraton really needs to work on giving the rooms a good scrubbing.,\n",
       " There were stains on the carbet near the bed which did not help their cause.,\n",
       " Also, the floor right along the floor boards needs a good vaccuming with the crevice tool.,\n",
       " I also had a plate in my room which I brought up on Day 1....it stayed with me until Day 5.The Ugly-The room was terribly small and a little tired.,\n",
       " The doors were so narrow that they remind me of those on a cruise ship where space is really limited.,\n",
       " Also, the bathroom was uncomfortably small, especially when staying sharing the room with the Mrs.,\n",
       " Conclusion-This is definitely the spot if you're looking for a good priced, centrally located hotel with a reputable brand and don't plan on spending lots of time actually in your room (i.e., you just go there to sleep and shower).Otherwise, if you are the type of traveler that also values your aesthetics of your room, then you might want to consider other options.,\n",

       " After seeing the nice lobby, the large stain (close to two feet across) which greeted us on the hallway floor near our room did not leave a good impression.,\n",
       " The room turned out to be a handicapped-accessible one; on the plus side, the bathroom was large, on the minus side, the overall dimensions of the room were lacking.,\n",

       " The bed was very comfortable, but the tv was old (no flat screen) and internet was not wireless.,\n",
       " The closet was very poorly laid out, since it had been adapted to be accessible nothing longer than three feet could be hung in it without being folded over.,\n",
       " The location of the hotel is excellent, as it is attached to a mall, and across the street from a subway stop, as well as being in walking distance to many shops and restaurants.,\n",
       " The pool was nice as well, and business services were fine.,\n",
       " Would I stay here again?,\n",
       " Definitely not if I were paying rack rate.,\n",

       " Our bill with tip was $55.53!,\n",
       " The charge for coffee and juice was very high!,\n",
       " We later complained to the front desk and were told that they get many complaints about this, but there was nothing they could do.,\n",

       " Just returned from Boston today, and have to say that the Boston Sheraton was a great place to stay for the Boston Marathon and for it's location overall.,\n",

       " Great City Break in Boston My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton for one night over the Easter weekend.,\n",
       " When we arrived we had our hire car valet parked, and our luggage was taken into the reception area for us.,\n",
       " Check-in was very quick and efficient, even though we arrived 2 hours before the stated check in time of 3pm.,\n",
       " We were given a room on the 24th Floor of the south tower.,\n",
       " It was a corner room, with full height windows to two sides, giving us a great view across Boston.,\n",
       " The room was very comfortable, and looked to have been recently redecorated.,\n",
       " The bathroom however looked rather tired, and although clean, was in need of refurbishment.,\n",
       " Despite being a fairly upscale Sheraton the room lacked certain features : there was no in room safe, which meant any valuables had to be left in safety deposit boxes at reception; there was no mini bar, or complimentary water, although coffee/tea were provided; there was no shower cap in the bathroom, and only small quantities of shower gel etc.,\n",
       " These are, however, minor issues, and did not impact on our overall enjoyment of the stay.,\n",
       " We were on a room only deal, but there is a Starbucks in the reception area where you can get coffee and muffins if you don't fancy the hotel's full breakfast.,\n",
       " The free internet service in the lobby is a real bonus, allowing us to check in for our return flight with ease.,\n",
       " The hotel links directly into the Prudential centre, a mid-scale shopping centre with a reasonable range of shops and restaurants.,\n",
       " This in turn links to the upscale Copley Plaza shopping centre, definately worth a visit!,\n",
       " Directly opposite the Sheraton (outside the Hilton hotel) is one of the stops for the Boston trolley bus sight seeing tours, and Newbury Street is a short walk from the hotel.,\n",

       " This time was the worst visit and the hotel played a major role in worsening the experience.,\n",
       " The rooms lack the basic tiny things that we found in other hotels in other states including Sheraton ones as well.,\n",
       " No safe inside the room to keep valuables.,\n",
       " Lighting inside the room is poor and reading was a problem.,\n",
       " Staff were nice but we were not able to get our bills in a way to report accurately to our institutions so they did whatever is suitable for them.,\n",
       " Pets were another problem that initiated allergy for some colleagues.,\n",
       " The breakfast was overpriced like any other hotel, but there was no balanced variety like in other hotels.,\n",
       " Pork is not the favorite breakfast meal for many.,\n",
       " The vending machine was out of order for ten consecutive days and may be more and when we called to complain the operator said try another floor.,\n",
       " This is awkard especially the rooms do not have any mini bar.,\n",
       " The telephones inside the rooms were not efficent.,\n",
       " We were not able to hear the speakers also the fees for a call was expensive even within USA hotels.,\n",
       " The only advantage is that it is related to the Prudential which is a great mall and outing space.,\n",
       " Also its location is great where you can vist some places by walking and easy to get the trolley.,\n",
       " I think some details can imporve the hotel.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Great for Irish Tourists..do not be put off!!!!,\n",
       " I just got back from the Sheraton and i had been so scared aout staying there after reading these reviews.,\n",
       " There was no need to be.,\n",
       " A lot of the American reviewers expected a lot...huge rooms etc.,\n",
       " The hotel is fab...you couldnt be in a better location so it is perfect for tourists.,\n",
       " You are attached to the prudential centre through the 2nd floor..great upmarket shops and places to eat (eat in the top of the hub once it is fab).,\n",
       " The t is also in the prudential and the trolley tours leave from right outside the door.,\n",
       " It is a 4 minute walk to newbury street..again great shops and cafes.,\n",
       " It is a 25 dollar cab ride to Logan and about 6dollars to Park Street and we paid 10 dollars to the Galleria (big mall in cambridge)The rooms were absolutely perfect.,\n",
       " If you are used to staying iin hotels like the Radisson..the rooms are of similar quality..the beds are better tho!,\n",
       " We booked a twin room and got 2 double beds, a huge TV, a big window, a nice desk and chair and a lovely coffee machine in the room.,\n",
       " All in all perfect!The bathrom is a little small but not tiny at all...absolutely fine.,\n",
       " We did stay in the south tower which was important to me after reading the reviews.,\n",
       " From the corridors, it loooks a bit more modern.,\n",
       " The lobby is beatiful, huge with lots of amenities and loads of nice places to sit and have a drink or read.,\n",
       " It has a buzz about it too...always people coming and going.,\n",
       " The staff in the side bar were lovely too, really friendly.,\n",
       " We had breakfast in the hotel one morning for convenience, overpriced but fine.,\n",
       " There is no need to eat there, eat in the mall!!Overall i really have few complaints!I travel a good bit, i have stayed in tiny European hotels and big 4 star hotel suites.,\n",
       " This hotel really was more than i expected.,\n",
       " If you are irish and are trying to imagine it... think of a 4 star Radisson at home and add about 1000 rooms and a much nicer lobby!Its not the luxury of the Fairmont Copley Plaza but i thought it was perfect.,\n",
       " BTW, i booked on reserve-hotel.com.,\n",
       " Got a rate of 93 euro a nite, an excellent rate!If yook via the hotel, you will pay about 3 times that!,\n",
       " \n",
       " Nothing Special - A bit dingy Needed to stay in Boston and looked around for a reasonable rate but most of the main hotels that I have used before (Marriott, Westin) were charging around $250-$300 per night.,\n",
       " This property was more reasonable so booked 3 nights via the SPG website chosing a Club room for $199 rather than a Standard at $159- Big mistake!The Room appeared to offer nothing much more than could be expected from a normal one and I agree with the other reviews here that the rooms are small (particularly the bathroom).,\n",
       " The only difference was the fact that it was on the 26th floor (the top 3 floors are the 'Club Floors') the corridor of which was very dark and by staying here you got access to their 'Club' on the 29th floor which whilst providing basic breakfast esentials looked tired as was not the sort of place I'd have wanted to have spent a lot of time.,\n",
       " Unlike previous lounges I have been to, it also charged for alcohlic beverages which made me wonder what was the point in paying an extra $40 per night if all I was getting for my money was a higher floor and a basic continental breakfast.,\n",
       " Needless to say the first night I and a colleague went there and were told it was $4 dollars for a beer we left and went to a bar with better decor and atmosphere!The other complaint I have with the room is that there was no in room safe-this is normally always provided in US hotels of this standard - I only keep my passport, travel tickets and some cash in them when they are provided but they are useful and being told by the hotel that they have safe deposit boxes at Reception was not a great solution.,\n",
       " This again left me wondering what I was paying for couldnt they put safes in the Club floor rooms to give an 'added benefit'?.I used the restaurant once for breakfast and the decor felt very tired and it was, like most hotels, overpriced for breakfast which I sometimes dont mind if it makes you feel like you are getting more for your money in terms of ambience etc.,\n",
       " The hotel is however situated in a good location attached to the Mall with restaurants nearby (I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs in the Mall and if travelling further afield Maggianos, Abe and Louies and Ruth Chris).Staff that I encountered were pleasant and overall the hotel delivered (i.e. a clean and comfortable room) it was just that I thought I would, with the room type I booked, and the fact that I am a Gold SPG holder, got something better.,\n",
       " Compared to the other hotels prices this still offered the best choice, however if you are going to Boston, compare prices and if you can get a deal at say Jury's or the Westin for $20-$30 dollars a night more stay there and leave the Sheraton.,\n",
       " \n",
       " worst club lounge Their club lounge is absolutely the worst I have ever been at any hotel and in any country.,\n",
       " The lounge is very small.,\n",
       " There is no staff on site.,\n",
       " I was doing interviews in the lounge when one of the hotel janitors came in and sat down in a massage chair, which is very close to us.,\n",
       " He turned on the massager, closed his eyes, and was really enjoying himself.,\n",
       " I have never seen a hotel staff taking advantage of the hotel amenities while on duty and in front of hotel guests.,\n",
       " I asked him to come back in an hour and he left to vaccum the floor.,\n",
       " It was 11am and I had to do the rest of my work elsewhere because of the noise.,\n",
       " The hotel location is convenient being adjacent to a mall.,\n",
       " I have stayed there 6 or 7 times in the past few years.,\n",

       " \n",
       " Great Beds This hotel offers all you would expect from a facility this large, but I never could have anticipate the level of comfort I would experience in their bed.,\n",
       " They really know what they're doing, and from the bed to the bedding, this is the standard to which I compare other accommodations.,\n",
       " Sounds funny, but I suppose sleeping is really what you're there to do.,\n",
       " Great location, decent staff and clean rooms.,\n",
       " The only complaint would be that you can't open the windows in the room, so you're dependent on the thermostat.,\n",
       " \n",
       " Nice hotel, great location The Sheraton Boston wasn't in itself anything incredibly special, although it was comfortable.,\n",
       " The rooms are smaller, but you can tell by the area that it's probably no different than other hotels around it.,\n",
       " The ottoman in my room had a questionable stain on it; other than that, the room was very clean.,\n",
       " At $20 for the duration of the stay, the gym was a bit expensive given the quality of equipment.,\n",
       " I didn't use the pool, though, which probably adds a lot of value to the cost.,\n",
       " I went to the bar for dinner, which is right off the lobby.,\n",
       " The service was good, the food tasty.,\n",
       " A big bonus is the mall that's attached to the hotel.,\n",
       " It had everything from fast food to Armani and high-end stores like it.,\n",
       " It gave me something to do at night.,\n",
       " There's also a few great bars within walking distance to the hotel.,\n",
       " The location really can't be beat.,\n",
       " The only complaint I have about my stay regarded room service.,\n",
       " The room next to me got room service one morning, and left the tray outside...it took the hotel almost 2 full days to pick it up!,\n",
       " It wasn't anything smelly, so it wasn't a big deal, but it showed a lack of attention.,\n",

       " What a joke.,\n",
       " Sheraton was disgusting.,\n",

       " Hadn't seen a renovation in at least 20 years.,\n",

       " South Tower is a bit scary too.,\n",
       " Dingy dark hallways with room service trays sitting around for who knows how long.,\n",

       " Location, location - but not much else My colleague and I were booked at the Sheraton because it was the official hotel for a large international conference we recently attended in Boston.,\n",
       " Thus, it was the maximally convenient location to be, and the network of walkways between the hotel, the convention center, and shopping/dining areas was very nice during this cold winter weather.,\n",
       " However, a number of other hotels are also so connected, and we were disappointed at how otherwise completely ordinary this Sheraton was (especially considering the room rates).,\n",
       " The lobby is grand, but the front desk was always understaffed.,\n",

       " The bathroom was small, with minimal amenities.,\n",
